Hello! âœ¨ðŸ˜€

I am a Full Stack developer with experience in developing complex web applications from planning to implementation. I have a strong knowledge of technologies such as React JS, NPM, Node js, Typescript, Express, and ASP.net.

I have worked on personal projects, creating efficient and scalable solutions for technical and business problems. I am passionate about continuous learning and experimenting with new technologies so that I can apply them to future projects.

My focus is on agile development and code quality, allowing me to create high-performance applications and user experiences. I love working in teams and collaborating with other developers to achieve common goals.

I am looking for opportunities to continue developing my skills as a Full Stack developer in a challenging and dynamic environment where I can apply my technical and creative abilities to solve problems and create high-quality software solutions.
